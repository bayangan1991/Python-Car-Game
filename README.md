# PyRacing

Simple toy game made with pygame to explore game programming with my kids.

You are the red car and your aim of the game is to not get pushed to the bottom of the screen.

Score is based on how many cars left the bottom of the screen

### Controls

| Key    | Description            |
|--------|------------------------|
| Arrows | Move the car           |
| Space  | Pause / Start the game |
| Esc    | Close the game         |

### Running the game

Only way to currently run the game is to install python. I use `uv` (and so should everyone else!).

After cloning the repository can install dependencies using `uv sync`

From there running the game is as simple as calling `uv run pyracing.py`
